Business-OnlinePayment-Multiplex version 0.01
=============================================

This module is a quick and dirt hack to allow a code callback from within
the Business::OnlinePayment content method which will be executed when the
submit action is called on the transaction.  This is useful for things like
switching processors depending on load and time of day, or sneakily saving
encrypted copies using StoredTransaction and various other things Visa/MC
don't want you to do.
